What is PvPGN?
* PvPGN (Player vs Player Gaming Network) is a free and open source software project offering emulation of various gaming network servers. It is published under the GPL and based upon bnetd.
* It currently supports most features of all Battle.net classic clients (Diablo, Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, StarCraft, StarCraft: Brood War, Warcraft II: Battle.net Edition, Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne). It also offers basic support for Westwood Online clients (Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge).

What is PvPGN password request?
* PvPGN password request is a script written in PHP with a PHP mailer built-in that allow any PvPGN client to recover the password through a Battle.net private server that is running on PvPGN. Officially, PvPGN has no built-in function to rocover a lost password and this script can be used to have that function working.

How is working?
* PvPGN does generate and output logs if a user is requesting a new password and if the username matches with the email address stored into the database. This script can be used as a Windows service which is running in the background checking every 5 seconds the logs generated by PvPGN. When somebody is requesting the password for their account this script will trigger and an email will be sent to the user with the password stored into the database.

Requirments:
* PvPGN logs must be enabled.
* SMTP Server.
* PHP Windows version.
* NSSM(the Non-Sucking Service Manager).

Tested on:
